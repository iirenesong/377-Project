# Job Finder

### Project Description:
At Job Finder, our mission is to connect job seekers with their ideal jobs by providing a user-friendly platform that allows for seamless job searching based on companies, titles, and locations. We've included information on various job positons, for those exploring different carrer options, or curious about a specific role. We strive to bridge the gap between employers and potential employees, we hope you enjoy using our application!ðŸ˜Š


### Description of Target Browsers (iOS? Android?):
Our target browsers include individuals on both iOS and Android, but for an easier viewing experience, we recommend using a laptop or computer. The API we chose, _Arbeitnow_, only offers job postings for different cities in Germany, so our target browsers would also be individuals searching for a job within Germany.
