# Job Finder

### Project Description:
At Job Finder, our mission is to connect job seekers with their ideal jobs by providing a user-friendly platform that allows for seamless job searching based on companies, titles, and locations. We strive to bridge the gap between employers and potential employees, we hope you enjoy using our application!ðŸ˜Š


### Description of Target Browsers (iOS? Android?):
Our target browsers include individuals on both iOS and Android, but for an easier viewing experience, we recommend using a laptop or computer. The API we chose, _Arbeitnow_, only offers job postings for different cities in Germany, so our target browsers would also be individuals searching for a job within Germany.
